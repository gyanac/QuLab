### **1. Towards the non-invasive imaging of brain networks and functions at high resolution**

We developed a new microscope system combining three-photon excitation and adaptive optics capable of 
high-resolution in vivo imaging of fine neuronal structures in the mouse cortex through intact skull of
mouse. We demonstrated the use of this platform to guide precise laser-mediated microsurgery through the 
intact skull and for accurate and sensitive functional calcium imaging of brain.<br />

Optical deep brain imaging in vivo at high resolution has remained a great challenge.
We developed an adaptive optics two-photon endomicroscopy providing a minimally invasive approach to image buried brain structures at high-resolution.
A new precompensation strategy plays a critical role to correct aberrations over large volumes and achieve rapid random-access multiplane imaging. We investigate the neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, a critical deep brain structure, and reveal the relationship between the somatic and dendritic activity of pyramidal neurons.

### **3. Adaptive optics two-photon microscopy for structural and functional retinal imaging**

<br />
In vivo fundus imaging offers non-invasive access to neuron structures and biochemical processes in the retina. 
However, optical aberrations of the eye degrade the imaging resolution and prevent visualization of subcellular retinal structures. 
We developed an adaptive optics two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (AO-TPEFM) system to correct ocular aberrations based on 
a nonlinear fluorescent guide star and achieved subcellular resolution for in vivo fluorescence imaging of the mouse retina. 
The AOTPEFM permits structural and functional imaging of the mouse retina with submicron resolution.
